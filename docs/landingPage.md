# FMS Documentation Homepage

This is the documentation homepage for the Flexible Modeling System(FMS), a software environment built for supporting atmospheric, oceanic, and climate system models on high-end computing architectures.

For documentation on the FMS codebase, a top level view of all modules by subdirectory can be
found in the 'Modules' section in the sidebar, or linked [**here**](modules.html).

Each module page has a link to it's file's page as well as any other files used in that module.
This is provided to give access to the interactive source code view, but the module pages should be
used for finding any information for a given module.

For more general information on FMS, it's uses, scope, and licensing, please see the project's
description page @ref rm "here".

For installation and building instructions and information, see @ref build "Building and Installation"

To contribute, all project code and contributing information can be found at <https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/FMS>.
Additionaly, please see the documentation style guide [**here**](md_docs_doxygenGuide.html) for how to document FMS code for this site.
